# Welcome to the Library.

Howdy! ^hehe^ This is my Library, where I keep various forms of documentation or prose
for my different odds and ends.

!!! note
    The information provided in my Library should not be fully considered as always 
    factual or truthful. Indeed, the nature of the written word is that there will
    always be some time when the text is outdated compared to the current practices
    or knowledge.

    While I will endeavour to keep my Library updated, to correct or remove 
    misinformation, I still wish to remind the viewer to take everything they read
    on the internet with a grain of salt.

I don't know what else to say really, other than good day and happy reading!
